# Predictive Maintenance Dashboard

This project predicts equipment failure based on input features using a machine learning model.

## Files
- `app.py`: The main Streamlit app.
- `prediction_result.csv`: This file stores prediction results and is used as a data source in Power BI.
- `your_dashboard.pbix`: A placeholder Power BI dashboard file.

## How to Use
1. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run app.py`.
2. The app generates predictions and saves them to `prediction_result.csv`.
3. Use `prediction_result.csv` as a data source in your Power BI dashboard.
